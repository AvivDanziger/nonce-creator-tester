                            <p>Takipi tells companies when and why their software breaks in production. Our product gives developers never before seen insight into their code - helping engineering teams understand which problems they need to work on, and what's actually causing them. With Takipi, companies can ship products more rapidly and with more confidence, and developers can spend their time shipping code instead of fixing it.</p>
                            <p>Backed by Menlo Ventures and founded by a team of experienced entrepreneurs, we're here to change how developers debug and fix their software at scale, and have fun doing it!</p>

                        <h3>Customer Success Manager (San-Francisco / U.S - remote)</h3>
                        <div class="jobDesc">
                            <p>We’re looking for someone to join our Customer Success team. As part of this role, you’ll be working deeply in two domains:</p>
                            <p>Pre-sale: With users during the trial period of the product, guiding and supporting them and making sure they successfully evaluate the product.</p>
                            <p>Post-sale: With customers, serving as a key point of contact, making sure they are trained, successfully utilize all the features in the product, and understand the value of Takipi.</p>
                            <p>This is a rare opportunity to experience the best of both worlds: a technical role working with developers and engineers, as well as a business role managing customer relationships and pre-sales activities. In addition, you will be working closely with the product team helping to shape the product and its marketing, as well as the engineering team solving customer problems. This is a true startup position, wearing multiple hats and being able to really move the needle.</p>
